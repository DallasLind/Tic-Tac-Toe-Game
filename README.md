### Game
This is a relatively simple take on Tic-Tac-Toe in which two players (Red or Blue) aim to get three consecutive(or diagonal) squares before the other player, but there's a possibility to tie! It's a simple quick game, but there's always room to make additional changes if need be.

### Challenges
The win conditional is really, really drawn out. I kind of wish I knew of a better method off of the top of my head, but I'm not sure where to start with that. At the moment, the win logic works and brings up an alert whenever a player wins! Yay!
